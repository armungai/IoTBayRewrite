6. To run the application locally you will need to create a database in the `.SmartTomcat` directory and point the `DBConnector` class to it
   1. First locate the directory of your Smart Tomcat Server. On Mac Systems this is usually located `Users/*your-username*/.SmartTomcat/IoTBay/itswd-assignment-1-group-1/`
   2. In here create a new file called `IoTBay.db`
   3. Copy this absolute path (should look like `/Users/andrewmungai/.SmartTomcat/IoTBay/itswd-assignment-1-group-1/IotBay.db`)
   4. In the RHS menu-bar of IntelliJ select the database icon:

   8. Navigate to `src/main/java/com/IoTBay/model/dao/DBConnector.java` and change line `17` to the file path found earlier. It should look like this:
   ```java
        String url = "jdbc:sqlite:/Users/armungai/.SmartTomcat/IoTBay/IoTDB.db";
7. Navigate to `src/Startup.sql`, right click and run the file. When prompted connect it to the database we just made
