6. To run the application locally, you will need to create a database in the `.SmartTomcat` directory and point the `DBConnector` class to it:

    1. Locate the directory of your Smart Tomcat server. On Mac systems this is usually located at:
       `/Users/*your-username*/.SmartTomcat/IoTBay/itswd-assignment-1-group-1/`
    2. In there, create a new file called `IoTBay.db`
    3. Copy the absolute path (e.g., `/Users/andrewmungai/.SmartTomcat/IoTBay/itswd-assignment-1-group-1/IoTBay.db`)
    4. In the IntelliJ right-side menu bar, select the **Database** icon

<br>

<br>

6. Locate the `IoTBay.db` on your system and select `SQLite` as the driver

<br>

8. Navigate to `src/main/java/com/IoTBay/model/dao/DBConnector.java`
   Change line 17 to the file path you copied earlier. It should look like:

```java
String url = "jdbc:sqlite:/Users/andrewmungai/.SmartTomcat/IoTBay/IoTBay.db";
```

7. Navigate to `src/Startup.sql`, right-click and run the file. When prompted, connect it to the database created earlier.
